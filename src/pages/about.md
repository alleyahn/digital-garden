## TL;DR

I'm Alleya Hanifa. **Alleya** for short. I'm a **Design Researcher** from Jakarta 🇮🇩 who's back in school to study Public Sector Innovation and eGovernance with the Erasmus Mundus framework.

When I was younger, I published several [children books](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3348307.Alline) and short stories, which is how you might have heard of me. Been blogging on different platforms (Multiply, Blogger, Tumblr, Wordpress) since 2008.
